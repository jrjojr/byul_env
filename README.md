# Byul's World â€“ Simulation & Pathfinding Engine

`byul` started as a **pathfinding engine**,  
and has evolved to include **maze generation, projectile trajectory prediction, control systems (MPC/PID), and numerical analysis**,  
making it a **lightweight and high-performance simulation engine**.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Pathfinding**  
  Supports A*, Dijkstra, BFS, D* Lite for both static and dynamic pathfinding.
- **Maze Generation**  
  Includes Binary Tree, Eller, Kruskal, and other maze generation algorithms.
- **Projectile Trajectory Prediction**  
  Predicts projectile paths with gravity, drag, and wind using RK4/Verlet integration.
- **Control Systems**  
  PID and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for path and motion control.
- **Numerical Core**  
  Implements vec3, quat, dualquat, dualnumber-based 3D math operations.
- **Modular Architecture**  
  Includes `numeq`, `controller`, `motion_state`, and `trajectory` as independent modules.

## ðŸ§ª Test Examples
### Pathfinding (A*)
```c
coord_t* start = coord_create_full(0, 0);
coord_t* goal = coord_create_full(9, 9);

REQUIRE_FALSE(coord_equal(start, goal));

std::cout << "default\n";
navgrid_t* m = navgrid_create();
// Insert obstacles (vertical block)
for (int y = 1; y < 10; ++y)
    navgrid_block_coord(m, 5, y);

route_finder_t* a = route_finder_create(m);
route_finder_set_goal(a, goal);
route_finder_set_start(a, start);
route_finder_set_visited_logging(a, true);
route_t* p = nullptr;

p = route_finder_find(a);
REQUIRE(p != nullptr);
CHECK(route_get_success(p) == true);
route_print(p);
navgrid_print_ascii_with_visited_count(m, p, 5);
route_destroy(p);    
route_finder_destroy(a);
navgrid_destroy(m);

coord_destroy(start);
coord_destroy(goal);
```

### Projectile Trajectory Prediction (RK4)
```c
linear_state_t projectile = { {0,0,0}, {10,10,0}, {0,0,0} };
environ_t env = environ_default();
bodyprops_t body = bodyprops_default();

linear_state_t predicted;
numeq_model_predict_rk4(1.0f, &projectile, &env, &body, 60, &predicted);

printf("Predicted position: %.2f, %.2f, %.2f\n",
       predicted.position.x, predicted.position.y, predicted.position.z);
```

## ðŸ“˜ Why `route` instead of `path`?

In Byul's World, the term **`route`** is used instead of `path` for the following reasons:

- `path` is commonly associated with filesystem paths, which can be confusing.
- `route` better reflects the **"strategic path to a destination"** in the context of games.
- The distinction between **static search (`route_finder`)** and **dynamic search (`dstar_lite`)** is clearer with `route`.

> This terminology is part of the design philosophy and is used consistently across the project.
