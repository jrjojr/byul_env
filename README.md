# üåü Byul's World ‚Äì Path Finding Engine

The `byul` module is a lightweight, high-performance engine  
designed for pathfinding in real-time simulation games.  
It focuses on three primary features: maze generation, route finding,  
and dynamic path recalculation, centered around the modules  
`maze`, `dstar_lite`, and `route_finder`.

---

## üß© Core Components

### üåÄ 1. Maze Generator ‚Äì `maze/`

A standalone maze generator that creates complex structures  
which can be inserted into a map as obstacles.

- Supported algorithms: Binary Tree, Prim, Eller, Kruskal, etc.
- Usage: generate with `maze_generate()` ‚Üí apply with `maze_apply_to_map()`
- Purpose: map setup, stage design, automated testing

#### Key Interface:
```c
maze_t* maze_new();
void maze_generate(maze_t* maze, maze_type_t type);
void maze_apply_to_map(const maze_t* maze, map_t* map);
void maze_free(maze_t*);
```

### üß† 2. D* Lite Module ‚Äì `dstar_lite/`

A fully implemented **D* Lite algorithm** for dynamic environments.  
The `dstar_lite_t` structure maintains internal state and  
automatically recalculates paths in response to obstacle changes.

- Key sorting: based on `dstar_lite_key`
- Priority queue: handled by `dstar_lite_pqueue`
- Heuristics: implemented via `dstar_lite_utils`

> Not a one-shot searcher ‚Äî it's a **persistent route engine** that responds to change.

---

### üö¶ 3. Static Route Finder ‚Äì `route_finder/`

A unified interface for static algorithms including  
A*, Dijkstra, BFS, JPS and more.  
Best suited for single-use searches on fixed maps.

- Uses `route_finder_t` to select algorithm and extract routes
- Main API: `route_finder_find()`

---

## üõ† Supporting Modules

### üìå `coord/`
- 2D integer coordinate structure (`coord_t`)
- Hash support (`coord_hash`), list operations (`coord_list`)

### üìå `map/`
- `map_t`: grid-based structure
- Determines walkability and obstacle positions
- Utility: `map_is_blocked(coord_t*)`

### üìå `cost_coord_pq/`
- Priority queue based on `coord + cost`
- Used during route expansion
- Custom lightweight heap implementation

---

## üìò Terminology ‚Äì Why use `route` instead of `path`?

In Byul's World, we prefer **`route`** over `path`. Here's why:

- `path` is ambiguous, often interpreted as a file system path
- In a game context, **"route" means intentional movement toward a goal"**
- When distinguishing between static (`route_finder`) and dynamic (`dstar_lite`) logic,
  the term `route` conveys **purpose, direction, and designed flow**

> This is a deliberate design choice ‚Äî all modules use `route` consistently.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Example

### üîπ Static A* Pathfinding

```c
coord_t* start = coord_new_full(0, 0);
coord_t* goal = coord_new_full(9, 9);

REQUIRE_FALSE(coord_equal(start, goal));

std::cout << "default\n";
map_t* m = map_new();
// Insert vertical wall
for (int y = 1; y < 10; ++y)
    map_block_coord(m, 5, y);

route_finder_t* a = route_finder_new(m);
route_finder_set_goal(a, goal);
route_finder_set_start(a, start);
route_finder_set_visited_logging(a, true);

route_t* p = route_finder_find(a);
REQUIRE(p != nullptr);
CHECK(route_get_success(p) == true);
route_print(p);
map_print_ascii_with_visited_count(m, p, 5);

route_free(p);    
route_finder_free(a);
map_free(m);
```

### üß© Summary

| Situation | Suggested Algorithm | Description |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Obstacles change frequently | D* Lite | Persistent state, real-time adaptation |
| Fixed map | A*, Dijkstra, etc. | Fast one-shot searches |
| Unified interface | `route_finder` | Switch between algorithms automatically |

## üí¨ Developer Note

This is not just a pathfinding module.  
It is the **core logic that gives life and movement** to Byul's World.

Mazes are the art of obstacles.  
Routes are the will to move.  
Finding them is how we ask the world a question.
