 * @note Minimum size:

 *       - height >= thickness × 2 + 1
 *       If smaller, there will be no inner space to form a donut shape.
 *
 * @note If `thickness` is too large and no inner space can be formed,
 *       the function returns NULL.
 *
 * @param start      One corner coordinate of the rectangular area
 * @param goal       Opposite corner coordinate
 * @param thickness  Thickness of the boundary wall (>=1)
 *                   A larger value creates a thicker outer ring
